# Student Loan calculator
The first Angular project I have ever worked on. Allows for the user to input data into the form in order to get calculations on how they can efficiently pay off their student loans.

## Notes
to run, make sure to install angular by using `npm install @angular/cli`  
after that, simply run `ng serve` to run the program (can add `--open` for it to pop up automatically)
